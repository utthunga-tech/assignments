### Design Patterns and Refactoring
A design pattern is a generic, reusable solution to a set of problems that arise frequently in software development. The pattern usually depicts the interactions and links between classes or items. The goal is to make the development process go faster by providing tried-and-true development and design paradigms. Design patterns are problem-solving methodologies that are independent of programming languages. A design pattern, thus, represents an idea rather than a specific implementation. You may make your code more flexible, reusable, and maintained by employing design patterns.
